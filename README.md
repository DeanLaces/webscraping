# Note to User
## Personal Information(Password/URL Path)
The password and url path for the chromedriver are machine specific. My machine is running on Linux Mint so its default path is downloaded to usr/local/bin/chromedriver.
For obvious reasons, I decided to NULL my values(I value my privacy lol).

## Common Errors

Because the ebayScraper and jobApplier both manage window handles, user interference during this operation will cause a NoSuchElementExcetpion if the page is changed. 
This is because the program anticipates the user to be on a certain portion of the site's code. 

## Terms of Service(TOS)

According to the robots.txt files of both sites, scraping on Indeed and eBay is allowed under their TOS granted the queried information is not personal or confidential. 
I do not assume legal risk for the use of this program to incite harm or reveal personal/financial information. Use at your own discretion.
